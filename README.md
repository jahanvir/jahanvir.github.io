# NeedsMapper -- Protototype Demo

Problem: 
I have seen people struggling to answer the question “What is your salary expectation? “. They often say random figure. Why? Because they don’t know their monthly expense or needs. May be that is reasonable, they might be moving to other city or country and they wouldn’t know product prices, Insurance premium, fuel prices, local food prices, House Rent there.
This isn’t only corporate problem. Students moving to another country for education face the same issue.

Solution: 
Living ambiguous life isn’t fun and it also add strain on your/parents’ pocket. NeedsMapper will solve that issue. Having facts at your fingertips keeps you out of hand from unnecessary mental strain.
NeedsMapper would have 5 sections,
•	Necessity (e.g., Grocery, Dairy products, vegetables, Fuel or Bus pass, Soap, Toiletry)
•	Investments and Future Plan (e.g., Insurance, Mutual Funds, Real Estate, Start-up)
•	Rent or EMI, Internet Plan, School fees
•	Healthy life style goals (e.g., Dry Fruits, Fruits, Gym/Zumba membership, Health grocery)
•	Comfort and Experience expense (e.g., Travelling, Restaurants, Occasional Snacks, Gifts, Festival, Celebration)
User can add their preferred options and city. NeedsMapper will find the price/expense of that choice. Now user can easily find their gross Need Range and plan accordingly. For example, NeedsMapper will use Jiomart’s price values to calculate range of grocery items, Policy Bazar to calculate Insurance premium.

Using NeedsMapper people can plan in advance before moving to live sustainable and healthy life.
